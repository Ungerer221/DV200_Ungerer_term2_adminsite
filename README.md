<h2 align="center">About this project </h2>

<h3 align="center">Project Description:</h3>
<p align="center">This term, we were tasked with developing an admin website that is to be used by the main receptionist in order to manage appointments, doctors, and patients.</p>

<h3 align="center">Built with:</h3>
<p align="center"> The site was built using primarily PHP and SQL. HTML was used for the structuring and content of the site, and CSS as well as Bootstrap was used for the styling.</p>

<ul >
  <li>PHP: used to code with connections to the database</li>
  <li>SQL: used to code the database</li>
  <li>HTML: to build the site</li>
  <li>CSS / Bootstrap: to style the website</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>
<h3 align="center">prerequisites</h3>
<p align="center">In order to use the site you would have to use the programe xamp as the localhost and SQL as your database</p>

<h2 align="center">Development Process</h2>
<h3 align="center">Implementation Process</h3>

<h3 align="center">Highlights:</h3>
<p align="center">some highlights where actualy getting some of the features to work as well as connecting the site to the database and having the two work together.</p>

<h3 align="center">Challenges:</h3>
<p align="center">the greatest chaalenge was to get certain features working such as the edit feature and the delete feature. thought I managed to get it working on some pages it wouldn't on other pages.</p>
<p align="center">I think the main issue was the SQL connection where when I wanted to update or delete something I may have typed the SQL syntax wrong</p>

<h2 align="center">Future Implementation</h2>
<P align="center">In the future I think I would rather structure my code and files betteras well as how I name my file and tables.</P>
<p align="center">for future implementations i could definitly use this methode to create more admin sites or sites that require a database.</p>
